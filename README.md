# Automatic Dog Ball Launcher

## Have you ever thought about how BORED your dog gets while you're away?

###### In this project, we are going to create an Automatic Dog Ball Launcher.


The Device functionality is:

- Detects if the ball is present using photodiodes
- Starts up two 12v motors 
- Controls a servo to delay the ball from falling straight into starting motors
- Releases the ball after a period of time determined by the mode it is in
- Displays the ball count for the person to see
- Displays which mode the device is in
- Flashes lights after each launch
- Turns on Hue lights before launching from RED - YELLOW - GREEN
- After 8 launches it will turn on the WEMO switches, which are connected to a fan for cooling of the dog
- Has an automatic Mode that cycles through the different power modes, slowly tiring the dog out
- Has a manual mode that lets the user chose which mode it will be in

###### Future Upgrades
- A more compact wiring setup
- A dog treat dispenser to help the training process
- A quieter motor
- Maybe a battery version that shoots further for the park or backyard mode 
- A lower profile funnel for smaller dogs
- Maybe a cat version?
